# Blue Enigma - Hybrid Chat Improvements & Fixes

## 1. Executive Summary

The initial AI assistant system was semi-functional and critically dependent on the OpenAI API, which was inaccessible due to `insufficient_quota` errors. The primary objective was to debug this core issue to achieve full end-to-end functionality.

The strategy was to **re-engineer the entire pipeline to use 100% free, locally-run models**, making the system robust, cost-free, and independent of cloud API rate limits. This involved significant modifications to both the data ingestion (`pinecone_upload.py`) and interactive chat (`hybrid_chat.py`) scripts.

Further improvements were made to enhance user experience, increase efficiency, improve the quality of the AI-generated responses, and add robustness.

## 2. Core Improvement: Transition to a Local Model Pipeline

### What We Did:

- Completely removed the dependency on the OpenAI API for both embedding generation and chat completion.

### Why We Did It:

- This was a necessary fix to overcome the `insufficient_quota` errors that made the original scripts non-functional. By moving to a local-first approach, the application is now:
  - **Fully Functional:** Runs end-to-end without billing or quota errors.
  - **Cost-Free:** Zero operational cost for API calls.
  - **Resilient:** Immune to cloud API rate limits and works offline once models are downloaded.
  - **Private:** User queries and data context are processed locally.

### How We Did It:

- Utilized two key open-source libraries:
  - **`sentence-transformers`:** For generating text embeddings locally.
  - **`Ollama`:** For serving a local Large Language Model (LLM) like Llama 3.

## 3. Detailed Changes in `pinecone_upload.py`

### Improvement 3.1: Local Embedding Generation

- **What:** Replaced OpenAIâ€™s `text-embedding-3-small` model with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` from the `sentence-transformers` library.
- **Why:** To generate all vector embeddings for the travel dataset locally, directly solving the API quota issue that prevented data upload.
- **How:**
  - **Library Change:** Removed the `openai` client dependency and imported `SentenceTransformer`.
  - **Model Loading:** Loaded the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model (small, fast, effective for semantic search) into memory at script start.
  - **Function Rework:** Rewrote the `get_embeddings` function to use `embed_model.encode(texts).tolist()` for local computation instead of making an API call.
  - **Vector Dimension Correction:** Corrected the Pinecone index configuration. OpenAI's model dimension is **1536**, while `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` uses **384**. Updated the `pinecone.create_index` call and `config.py` to use `dimension=384`. _This required deleting any pre-existing incompatible index._
  - **Rate Limit Handling Removed:** Removed `time.sleep()` calls previously needed for API rate limiting, speeding up the upload process.

## 4. Detailed Changes in `hybrid_chat.py`

The chat script saw significant improvements to fix core functionality, enhance performance and robustness, and improve final output quality.

### Improvement 4.1: Consistent Local Embeddings for Queries

- **What:** Updated the `embed_text` function to use the same `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from `sentence-transformers` used during data upload.
- **Why:** Essential for accurate vector search. The query vector and document vectors _must_ originate from the same model to exist in the same vector space.
- **How:** Loaded the `SentenceTransformer` model at script start and modified `embed_text` to call `embed_model.encode(text).tolist()`.

### Improvement 4.2: Local LLM for Chat Completion via Ollama

- **What:** Replaced the OpenAI chat completion call (previously `gpt-4o-mini`) with a local `llama3` model served by the `Ollama` framework.
- **Why:** Completes the transition to a fully local, cost-free, and private pipeline, eliminating API errors.
- **How:**
  - Installed and imported the `ollama` Python library.
  - Rewrote the chat execution function (`call_chat` became `stream_chat`) to use `ollama.chat(...)`, sending prompts to the locally running `llama3` model.

### Improvement 4.3: Streaming Output for Improved User Experience

- **What:** Converted the chat execution function (`call_chat`) into `stream_chat`, enabling real-time streaming output.
- **Why:** CPU-based LLM inference can cause noticeable delays. Streaming shows the response as it's generated, making the application feel much more responsive and interactive, significantly improving the user experience compared to waiting for the full response.
- **How:** Implemented by iterating through the response stream from `ollama.chat(..., stream=True)` and printing each `chunk` immediately using `print(part, end='', flush=True)`.

### Improvement 4.4: Embedding Caching for Efficiency

- **What:** Implemented a simple dictionary-based cache (`embedding_cache`) for the `embed_text` function.
- **Why:** Avoids redundant embedding computation for identical user queries within the same session, slightly improving response time and reducing unnecessary CPU load.
- **How:** Added a check at the beginning of `embed_text`:
  ```python
  if text in embedding_cache:
      return embedding_cache[text]
  else:
      # Compute, store in cache, then return
      embedding = embed_model.encode(text).tolist()
      embedding_cache[text] = embedding
      return embedding
  ```

### Improvement 4.5: Advanced Prompt Engineering

- **What:** Significantly restructured and detailed the prompt sent to the LLM within the `build_prompt` function.
- **Why:** Local models like Llama 3 benefit greatly from clear, explicit instructions. The improved prompt aims to minimize hallucinations (inventing facts), enforce strict use of provided context, and encourage more structured, relevant answers, especially for itinerary requests.
- **How:**
  - **Stricter System Message:** Clearly defined the AI's role (Vietnam travel assistant), knowledge limitations (context only), context usage rules (Pinecone for relevance, Neo4j for details), ID citation requirements, and fallback instructions (state when info is missing). Explicitly forbade using outside knowledge.
  - **Structured Context Presentation:** Used Markdown headers (`### Context from...`) to clearly separate semantic search results from knowledge graph facts, aiding model comprehension. Included relevant `Tags` in the semantic context.
  - **Detailed Itinerary Rules:** Added specific instructions within the system prompt for generating itineraries (day-by-day structure, use of context items + IDs, theme matching).
  - **Chain-of-Thought Task List:** Provided a numbered list under `### Task:` in the user prompt, guiding the model through a logical sequence (analyze query, identify entities, use graph facts, synthesize answer, handle itinerary format, cite IDs, state limitations).

### Improvement 4.6: Enhanced Robustness and Error Handling

- **What:** Added connection verification and more specific error handling.
- **Why:** To make the application more stable and provide clearer feedback if connections to essential services (Pinecone, Neo4j, Ollama) fail.
- **How:**
  - Added `driver.verify_connectivity()` for Neo4j.
  - Added checks for Pinecone index existence.
  - Added a basic `ollama.list()` call within a `try...except ConnectionRefusedError` block in `stream_chat` to check if the Ollama server is running before attempting a chat request.
  - Used `.get()` with default values when accessing potentially missing keys in dictionaries (e.g., Pinecone metadata, Neo4j results).
  - Added `try...except KeyboardInterrupt` for graceful exit.
  - Ensured Neo4j driver is closed properly using a `finally` block.

### Improvement 4.7: Neo4j Query Refinement

- **What:** Modified the `fetch_graph_context` function.
- **Why:** To make the graph context sent to the LLM more useful and concise.
- **How:**
  - Added a query to fetch the _names_ of the source nodes identified by Pinecone, allowing the prompt to include names like `(city_hanoi - Hanoi)` instead of just IDs.
  - Added `LIMIT 5` to the relationship query for each node to prevent overwhelming the LLM prompt with too many facts.
  - Shortened the retrieved `target_desc` length (`[:200]`).
